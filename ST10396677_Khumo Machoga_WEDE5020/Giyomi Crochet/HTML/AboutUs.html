    <h1> Creator & Owner of Giyomi Creations</h1>
    <p>I am a 20-year-old girl who has a passion for art.And what better way to show my creative side than through 
        something that will last forever. I took an interest in crochet and knitting since I was 16 years-old.I wanted
        to create items that I would buy from a store.I started making my friends and myself pieces from little 
        projects and made them in my spare time. I'm always trying to take inspiration from other creators projects
        from things like a pattern I've seen on a jersey to blankets. I have never seen creators create bags in 
        South Africa from these designs so I decided to create bags from patterns I've seen. I hope you'll carry
        a little piece of mywild imagination to your next outing!
